Project2: Enterprise Software Deployment Project

Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a centralized software distribution system using Windows Server 2022
and Active Directory Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The primary goal was to automate the installation of Mozilla Firefox across domain-joined client machines to ensure 
software consistency and reduce manual administrative overhead.

Core Technical Skills Demonstrated:
• Active Directory Management: Organized and managed computer objects within specific Organizational Units (OUs) for targeted policy application.
• Network Resource Provisioning: Established a secure network share with NTFS and Sharing permissions specifically configured for 
Domain Computers to allow machine-level access during the boot process.
• GPO Configuration: Provisioned an MSI software package using UNC (Universal Naming Convention) network paths to ensure high availability across the network.
• Client-Side Troubleshooting: Utilized command-line tools like gpupdate /force to trigger immediate policy refreshes and verified successful deployment 
on Windows 10 workstations.
